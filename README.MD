# anonMA
Anonymous Messaging Application (anonMA) - A very basic web-based chat application written in Django that has basic messaging capabilities and deletes all data upon session exit.

### How to run
1. Make sure Python and Django are installed on your system.
2. Clone and download the repository. 
3. Run `python manage.py runserver` to run Django's development server on your localhost.

This project isn't currently hosted on an actual server, so that's how you would run it.
